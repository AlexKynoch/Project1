        <p><h3><br>Branches</h3></p>
        <p>The Master branch is where all the deployable code is kept.  if you are working on that code you dont want to do it in master incase you break something.  
            Instead you can create a branch from master called a feature branch which creates a seperate area to safely develop your code. The image above shows a feature 
            branch being created from the master branch.
        <p><h3>Commit</h3></p>
        <p>Once you have made changes in your feature branch you will need to save it to your local computer - this is called a commit.  Once you save your work in a Commit
            you will get a reference number.
        <p><h3>Pull Request</h3></p>
