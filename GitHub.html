        <h1>Remote Repositories</h1>
       
      
        
        
        <p>Git status shows we are currently on the master branch we donâ€™t want 
        to push our code to the master branch as the master branch is used for production ready 
        working code. if our work was only partially completed or wrong it would break code that 
        is currently on the master branch and working. It is safer to move our files onto a 
        different branch to make changes.</p>

        <img src = "images/workflow.png"><br>

        <p>We can create a feature branch from master to make our changes in we can stage our files 
            and commit them from the new branch and later when everything is completed and working 
            properly, we can push them to master.</p>
            <p>If we were working on a landing page we could type
            <b>git branch landing page</b> this would create a feature branch called landing page.</p>
        <img src = "images/newBranch.png"><br>
        <p>We are still on the master branch to change to the landing page branch we need git checkout 
        name of branch <b>git checkout landingPage</b>.</p>
        <img src = "images/gitCheckout.png"><br>
        <p>Now we are on the landing page branch. This has our index.html file in it and is currently 
            the same as the one in master</p>
        <img src = "images/landingPageBranch.png"><br>
        <p>But now if we make changes.</p>
        <img src = "images/changeFileNewBranch.png"><br>
        <img src = "images/changeFileNewBranchChrome.png"><br>
        <p>Stage and commit them.</p>
        <img src = "images/commitToNewBranch.png"><br>
        <p>They are saved to the landing page branch but not the master branch, we can go back to master 
        to see using <b>git checkout master</b> master still has this version.</p>
        <img src = "images/masterVersion.png"><br>
        <img src = "images/masterVersionChrome.png"><br>
        <p>In the landingPage branch we can make changes, stage and commit them and master will not be 
        changed as the commits are being made to the landingPage branch instead of master.</p>
        <p>Now everthing is completed we can merge everthing back into master.  We need to go into the 
        master branch <b>git checkout master</b> and git merge branch name <b>git merge landingPage.</b></p>
        <img src = "images/gitMerge.png"><br>
        <p>Now when we look at index.html from master it includes our changes.</p>
