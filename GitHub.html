        <h1>Remote Repositories</h1>
        <h2>Making a Remote Repository</h2>

        <p>To create a remote repository and link it to our local. Go to <b>GitHub</b> sign in and click on <b>your
                repositories</b>.</p>

        <img src="images/yourRepositoriesGitHub.png" alt="Your repositories page in GitHub"><br>

        <p>Click <b>New</b>.</p>

        <img src="images/createNewRepositoryGithub.png" alt="Page in Github to create a new repsitory."><br>

        <p>Give it a name, description choose public or private etc you can choose to add a README file if you want this
            is a place
            to store details of what your repository is about for anyone who uses it.</p>
        <img src="images/createNewRepositoryGithub2.png" alt="Page in Github to create a new repsitory with name HelloWorld 
        added for new repository name."><br>
        <p>Click <b>create repository</b>.</p>
        </p>
        <img src="images/getGithubLink.png"
            alt="Set up page in GitHub with git remote add origin and url of new repositry highlighted."><br>
        <p>Copy the highlighted link and go back to bash.</p>

        <h2>Adding a Remote Repository to your project</h2>
        <p><b>git remote</b> lists the remote repositories.</p>
        <img src="images/gitRemote.png" alt="Bash entered git remote bash response nothing."><br>
        <p>There are no remote repositories to add the new one we just made paste the highlighted line into bash</p>
        <img src="images/pasteRemoteAddressBash.png"
            alt="Entered git remote add origin https://github.com/AlexKynoch/HelloWorld.git bash entered git remote bash response origin."><br>
        <p>Now we have added our remote repository to git and it is called origin. Now copy and paste the next
            highlighted line into bash.</p>
        <img src="images/pasteNextLineFromGitHub.png"
            alt="Set up page in GitHub with git push -u origin master highlighted."><br>
        <img src="images/pasteNextLineFromGitHub2.png"
            alt="Bash git push -u origin master Bash response Branch master set up to track remote branch master from origin."><br>
        <p>This pushes everything to the new repository when you refresh GitHub all your files should be there.</p>
        <img src="images/filesInGithub.png" alt="GitHub repository now showing index.html file saved "><br>
        <h2>Adding new content</h2>

        <p>Index.html is now in the remote repository. If we add a new file</p>
        <img src="images/addANewFile.png" alt="Bash entered nano landingPage.html"><br>
        <p>Add content to it.</p>
        <img src="images/newFileInNano.png"
            alt="Simple html file created in nano editor with title Hello world and Landing page coming soon in body."><br>
        <p>Its not tracked. (Probably should have done this in a feature branch you can find out all about branches on
            the
            <a href="branches.html">branches page</a>).</p>

        <img src="images/untrakedFiles.png" alt='Bash entered git status bash response untracked files landingPage.html nothing added to commit but untracked
        files present use "git add" to track.'><br>
        <p><b>git add .</b> to stage it, now it is being tracked and <b>git commit</b>.</p>
        <img src="images/addAndCommit.png"
            alt='Bash entered git add. entered git status bash response changes to be committed new file landingPage.html bash 
        entered git commit -m"landingPage.html file created bash response 1 file changed create mode 100644 landingPage.html.'><br>
        <h2>Pushing to GitHub</h2>

        <p>The new file landingPage.html is saved but only to our local repository to send it to the remote
            repository we need <b>git push</b>.</p>
        <img src="images/gitPush.png" alt="Bash entered git push response done."><br>
        <p>This pushes everything to our remote repository in GitHub and we can see it when we refresh.</p>
        <img src="images/filesinGithub2.png"
            alt="GitHub repository now showing two files saved index.html and landingPage.html "><br>
        <p>To check if everthing is up to date we can do <b>git pull</b>.</p>
        <img src="images/gitPull.png" alt="Bash entered git pull bash response Already up to date."><br>
        <p>Everthing is up to date but if someone else had made changes committed them and pushed them to the remote
            repository and we did a git pull it would bring us all the latest changes.</p>
        <p>Now if we accidentally deleted <b>.git</b> it wouldnt be so bad as we have saved a copy of all our files
            to GitHub. (This statement is true as long as we dont change anthing).</p>
