        <h1>Remote Repositories</h1>
        <h2>Making a Remote Repository</h2>
       
      
        
        
        <p>To create a remote repository and link it to our local. Go to <b>GitHub</b> sign in and click on <b>your repositories</b>.</p>

        <img src = "images/yourRepositoriesGitHub.png"><br>

        <p>Click <b>New</b>.</p>
            
        <img src = "images/createNewRepositoryGithub.png"><br>

        <p>Give it a name, description choose public or private etc you can choose to add a README file if you want this is a place 
        to store details of what your repository is about for anyone who uses it.</p>
        <img src = "images/createNewRepositoryGithub2.png"><br>
        <p>Click <b>create repository</b>.</p></p>
        <img src = "images/getGithubLink.png"><br>
        <p>Copy the highlighted link and go back to bash.</p>
        
        <h2>Adding a Remote Repository to your project</h2>
        <p><b>git remote</b> lists the remote repositories.</p>
        <img src = "images/gitRemote.png"><br>
        <p>There are no remote repositories to add the new one we just made paste the highlighted line into bash</p>
        <img src = "images/pasteRemoteAddressBash.png"><br>
        <p>Now we have added our remote repository to git and it is called origin. Now copy and paste the next 
        highlighted line into bash.</p>
        <img src = "images/pasteNextLineFromGitHub.png"><br>
        <img src = "images/pasteNextLineFromGitHub2.png"><br>
        <p>This pushes everything to the new repository when you refresh GitHub all your files should be there.</p>
        <img src = "images/filesInGithub.png"><br>
        <h2>Adding new content</h2>

        <p>Index.html is now in the remote repository. If we add a new file</p>
        <img src = "images/addANewFile.png"><br>
        <p>Add content to it.</p>
        <img src = "images/newFileInNano.png"><br>
        <p>Its not tracked. (Probably should have done this in a feature branch you can find out all about branches on the
        <a href = "branches.html">branches page</a>).</p>
        
        <img src = "images/untrakedFiles.png"><br>
        <p><b>git add .</b> to stage it, now it is being tracked and <b>git commit</b>.</p>
        <img src = "images/addAndCommit.png"><br>
        <h2>Pushing to GitHub</h2>

        <p>The new file landingPage.html is saved but only to our local repository to send it to the remote 
        repository we need <b>git push</b>.</p>
        <img src = "images/gitPush.png"><br>
        <p>This pushes everything to our remote repository in GitHub and we can see it when we refresh.</p>
        <img src = "images/filesinGithub2.png"><br>
        <p>To check if everthing is up to date we can do <b>git pull</b>.</p>
        <img src = "images/gitPull.png"><br>
        <p>Everthing is up to date but if someone else had made changes committed them and pushed them to the remote 
        repository and we did a git pull it would bring us all the latest changes.</p>
        <p>Now if we accidentally deleted <b>.git</b> it wouldnt be so bad as we have saved a copy of all our files
        to GitHub. (This statement is true as long as we dont change anthing).</p>
