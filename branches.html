        <p>Git status shows we are currently on the master branch we donâ€™t want 
        to push our code to the master branch as the master branch is used for production ready 
        working code. if our work was only partially completed or wrong it would break code that 
        is currently on the master branch and working. It is safer to move our files onto a 
        different branch to make changes.</p>

        <img src = "images/workflow.png"><br>

        <p>We can create a feature branch from master to make our changes in we can stage our files 
            and commit them from the new branch and later when everything is completed and working 
            properly, we can push them to master.</p>
            <p>If we were working on a landing page we could type
            <b>git branch landing page</b> this would create a feature branch called landing page.</p>
        <img src = "images/newBranch.png"><br>
        <p>We are still on the master branch to change to the landing page branch we need git checkout 
        name of branch <b>git checkout landingPage</b>.</p>
        <img src = "images/gitCheckout.png"><br>
        <p>Now we are on the landing page branch</p>
