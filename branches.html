        <h1>Branches</h1>

        <p>Git status shows we are currently on the master branch we donâ€™t want
            to push our code to the master branch as the master branch is used for production ready
            working code. if our work was only partially completed or wrong it would break code that
            is currently on the master branch and working. It is safer to move our files onto a
            different branch to make changes.</p>

        <img src="images/workflow.png" alt="GitHub workflow diagram. Creating a feature branch from master. 
        Master represented as a horizontal line, the feature branch line moves down from master following in
        paralell to the right with circles along the way to highlight. Making commits, submitting pull requests and 
        discussing proposed changes until both lines converge again at merge feature branch back into master" .><br>

        <p>We can create a feature branch from master to make our changes in we can stage our files
            and commit them from the new branch and later when everything is completed and working
            properly, we can push them to master.</p>
        <h2>Creating a feature file</h2>
        <p>If we were working on a landing page we could type
            <b>git branch landingPage</b> this would create a feature branch called landing page.</p>
        <img src="images/newBranch.png" alt="Bash entered - git branch landingPage"><br>
        <p>We are still on the master branch to change to the landing page branch we need git checkout
            name of branch <b>git checkout landingPage</b>.</p>
        <img src="images/gitCheckout.png"
            alt="entered git checkout landingPage bash response switched to branch 'landingPage'."><br>
        <p>Now we are on the landing page branch. This has our index.html file in it and is currently
            the same as the one in master</p>
        <img src="images/landingPageBranch.png"
            alt="Entered ls bash response shows index.html on landingPage branch"><br>
        <h2>Making changes on the feature file</h2>
        <p>But now if we make changes.</p>
        <img src="images/changeFileNewBranch.png"
            alt="Notepad -This will be the landing page,  Added to the body of simple html file"><br>
        <img src="images/changeFileNewBranchChrome.png"
            alt="Chrome web browser - This will be the landing page, this is my first website Lets change this."><br>
        <p>Stage and commit them.</p>
        <img src="images/commitToNewBranch.png" alt='git commit -m "marker placed for landing page" bash response landingPage 038079e marker placed for landing page. 
        git status bash Response on branch landingPage nothing to commit working tree clean'><br>
        <p>They are saved to the landing page branch but not the master branch, we can go back to master
            to see using <b>git checkout master</b> master still has this version.</p>
        <img src="images/masterVersion.png"
            alt="Notepad -This will be the landing page,  no longer in the body of simple html file"><br>
        <img src="images/masterVersionChrome.png"
            alt="Chrome web browser - This is my first website Lets change this."><br>
        <h2>Merging back to master</h2>
        <p>In the landingPage branch we can make changes, stage and commit them and master will not be
            changed as the commits are being made to the landingPage branch instead of master.</p>
        <p>Now everthing is completed we can merge everthing back into master. We need to go into the
            master branch <b>git checkout master</b> and git merge branch name <b>git merge landingPage.</b></p>
        <img src="images/gitMerge.png" alt="entered git checkout master bash response switched to branch 'master' git merge landingPage
        bash response index.html 1 file changed  1 insertion."><br>
        <p>Now when we look at index.html from master it includes our changes.</p>
        <img src="images/masterWithChanges.png"
