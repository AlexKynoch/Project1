        <h1>Making a local Repository</h1>
       
      <!-- <h3>Local Repositories</h3>
      
      <p>Git puts a <b>.git</b> folder within the route of your project this is your 
        local repository its local to you as it is on your computer/laptop. 
        The git repository <b>.git</b> is going to keep track of all the versions of the 
        files in your project which is good if you break something and want to restore a previous version of your file.</p>
        <p>So don’t delete it or it will delete all the previous versions of your file 
        and you will be left with just the one you have now, (if you haven’t saved 
        it to a remote repository). We can access git locally at the command line 
        using git bash or in the terminal of Visual Studio Code.</p> 
        <h3>Remote Repositories</h3>
      
        <p>Your local repository .git will also keeps track of other repositories 
        you can also have a remote repository in this case GitHub.  GitHub allows 
        you to send (<b>push</b>) your files to GitHub to be saved there as well and to retrieve 
        (<b>pull</b>) files from GitHub to use locally.</p> -->

        <h2>Making a folder</h2>
        
        <p>Before we can make a local repository we need to create a folder i made 
        mine on desktop and called it HelloWorld.</p>
        <img src = "images/newFolder.png">

        <h2>Opening bash</h2>

        <p>Right click on folder and choose – <b>git bash here</b> to open a git bash window.
            This saves you having to open a bash window and navigate to your folder as it is 
            already there.</p>
            <img src = "images/bashOpening.png">

            <h2>Making a file with touch</h2>

            <p>Now we can create a new file called index.html using <b>touch</b>.</p>
            <img src = "images/newTouch.png"><br>

            <p>We can see this file has now appeared in our folder in <b>File Explorer.</b></p>
            <img src = "images/fileExplorer.png">

            <p>Or We can use <b>ls</b> in bash to list the files in our directory.</p>
            <img src = "images/lsBash.png">

            <h2>Making a file with nano</h2>

            <p>We could also have created a file using <b>nano</b> instead, nano 
            allows you to add content to your file.</p>
            <img src = "images/nano.png">

            <p><b>Ctrl x</b> to escape nano.</p>
            <img src = "images/nanoEdit.png">

            <p><b>Y</b> or <b>N</b> to save changes or not.</p>
            <img src = "images/nanoSave.png">

            <p>And <b>enter</b> to go back to bash.</p>
            <img src = "images/nanoB2Bash.png">

            <p>This looks the same as when we used <b>touch</b> to create a file but 
            by using <b>nano</b> we have created a file and added content as well.</p>
            <img src = "images/nanoLsBash.png">

            <p>In <b>File Explorer</b> the file size has grown from 0 to 1KB.</p>
            <img src = "images/nanoFileExplorer.png">

            <p>And in <b>Chrome</b> it looks like this.</p>
            <img src = "images/nanoInChrome.png">

            <h2>Adding git</h2>

            <p>To initialize this folder as a git repository (to put git in this folder) use <b>$git init</b>.</p>
            <img src = "images/gitInitialize.png">

            <p>you cant see it in <b>File Explorer</b> because it is a hidden file.</p>
            <img src = "images/fileExplorerGit.png">

            <p>Although you can change the settings to show hidden files using view then options folder if you want 
            to see it. It would appear as <b>.git</b> (I’m not going to do that. If you can't see it you can't 
            accidentally delete it).</p>

            <p>Before git will track our changes we need to stage our files and commit them.</p>
