    <h1>What is a Repository?</h1>

    <h2>Local Repositories</h2>

    <p>Git puts a <b>.git</b> folder within the route of your project this is your
      local repository its local to you as it is on your computer/laptop.
      The git repository <b>.git</b> is going to keep track of all the versions of the
      files in your project which is good if you break something and want to restore a previous version of your file.
    </p>
    <p>So don’t delete it or it will delete all the previous versions of your file
      and you will be left with just the one you have now, (if you haven’t saved
      it to a remote repository). We can access git locally at the command line
      using git bash or in the terminal of Visual Studio Code.</p>
    <h2>Remote Repositories</h2>

    <p>Your local repository .git will also keeps track of other repositories
      you can also have a remote repository in this case GitHub. GitHub allows
      you to send (<b>push</b>) your files to GitHub to be saved there as well and to retrieve
      (<b>pull</b>) files from GitHub to use locally.</p>
