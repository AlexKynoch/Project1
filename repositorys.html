      <h3>Local Repositories</h3>
      
      <p>Git puts a .git/ folder within the route of your project this is your 
        local repository its local to you as it is on your computer/laptop. 
        The git repository .git is going to keep track of all the versions of the 
        files in your project which is good if you break something and want to restore a previous version of your file.</p>
        <p>So don’t delete it or it will delete all the previous versions of your file 
        and you will be left with just the one you have now, (if you haven’t saved 
        it to a remote repository). We can access git locally at the command line 
        using git bash or in the terminal of Visual Studio Code.</p> 
        <h3>Remote Repositories</h3>
      
        <p>Your local repository .git will also keeps track of other repositories 
        you can also have a remote repository in this case GitHub.  GitHub allows 
        you to push (send) your files to GitHub to be saved there as well and to pull 
        (retrieve) files from GitHub to use locally.</p>
