      <p>Git is a distributed version control system for tracking changes 
        in computer files – but what does that mean? Distributed means its 
        de-centralized so many developers can work on the same project without 
        having to be on the same network. I could be on a sunny beach in Spain, 
        you could be in rainy Sheffield and we could both be working on the 
        same project through git.</p> 
      <p>Version control: git coordinates work between multiple developers and 
        tracks every single version and change that is made in the project.
        Git is not language specific it just saves files whether they are written 
        in Java, HTML, or any other language. Git allows you to revert back to a 
        previous version as long as that version was commited to the repository 
        – but what is a repository?</p>
