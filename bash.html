        <h1>Navigating the Unix Shell (Bash)</h1>
        <h2>Creating a bash shell</h2>

        <p>We already know how to create a new folder and open a bash shell from it,
            but what if we just open bash on its own how do we find the directory we want.
        </p>

        <img src="images/bashOpening2.png" alt="Bash opening.">
        <p>Wherever bash opens <b>cd</b> takes you to your home directory. <b>ls</b> lists
            everthing in that directory</p>
        <p>ls -F shows us what type they are by adding an extra character:</p>
        <ul class="list2">
            <li><b>@</b> is a symlink</li>
            <li><b>/</b> is a directory</li>
            <li><b>|</b> is a named pipe</li>
            <li><b>=</b> is a socket</li>
            <li><b>*</b> is an executable file</li>
        </ul>
        <img src="images/cdInBash.png" alt="Bash entered cd bash entered ls.">


        <h2>Navigating to our folder</h2>



        <p>My folder's location is C:\Users\alex\Desktop\HelloWorld\HelloWorld. <b>pwd</b> prints the path
            of the current working directory.</p>
        <img src="images/usersBash.png" alt="bash entered pwd bash response /c/users/alex.">
        <p>So we are currently in /c/Users/alex and need to get to C:\Users\alex\Desktop\HelloWorld\HelloWorld
        </p>
        <img src="images/upALevelBash.png" alt="Bash response huge list of files only last 3 shown in image.">
        <p><b>ls</b> listed too many files to show but one of them was Desktop. <b>cd and the folder name </b>
            takes you into that folder.</p>
        <p><b>cd Desktop</b>
            to get into Desktop, <b>cd HelloWorld</b> to get into HelloWorld and <b>cd HelloWorld</b> again
            to get into the folder called HelloWorld.</p>


        <img src="images/navigateToFolderBash.png" alt="Bash entered cd Desktop/ enter cd HelloWorld enter cd 
        HelloWorld/ enter ls bash response index.html landingPage.html.">

        <h2>Making a directory</h2>
        <p>Now we are where we wanted to be we can make new directory with <b>mkdir</b></p>

        <img src="images/mkDirBash.png"
            alt="Bash entered mkdir backup enter bash entered ls bash response backup/ index.html landingPage.html.">

        <h2>Making a file for the directory</h2>
        <p>We can create files to go in this directory by going into the new directory <b>cd
                backup</b> using nano or touch as we did previously.</p>
        <h2>Copying a file into a directory</h2>
        <p>we can also copy files with <b>cp</b>, we can copy landingPage.html into our new
            directory backup using the name of the file we want to move and its new location
            with <b>cp landingPage.html backup/
            </b> </p>
        <img src="images/copyFileBash.png" alt="Bash entered cp landingPage.html backup/ bash entered 
        ls bash response backup/ index.html landingPage bash entered cd backup/ bash entered ls 
        bash response landingPage.html.">
        <h2>Copying a directory</h2>
        <p>We can also copy directories with cp - r the name of the directory we want to copy
            and the name for the new copy<b> cp -r backup/ backup_again</b></p>
        <img src="images/copyDirectoriesBash.png" alt="Bash entered cp -r backup/ backup_again bash entered 
        ls bash response backup/ backup_again/ index.html landingPage.html bash entered cd backup_again bash entered
        ls bash response landingPage.html.">
        <h2>Removing a file</h2>

        <p>We can remove a file using <b>rm</b> and the name of the file <b>rm landingPage.html</b></p>
        <img src="images/removingFileBash.png"
            alt="Bash entered rm landingPage.html bash entered ls bash response empty.">
        <h2>Removing a directory</h2>
        <p>We can remove the backup_again directory using <b>rm -ir</b> and the directory name <b>rm -ir
                backup_again</b></p>

        <img src="images/removeDirectoryBash.png" alt="Bash entered rm -ir backup-again/ bash response rm: remove directory 
        'backup_again/'? bash entered Y bash entered ls bash response backup/ index.html landingPage.html. " .>

        <h2>Moving files</h2>

        <p>We can move index.html into landingPage.html with <b>mv</b> current file name and file name where it is going
            (target)
            <b>mv index.html landingPage.html</b></p>
        <img src="images/moveFilesBash.png" alt="Bash entered mv index.html landingPage.html bash entered ls bash response backup/
        landingPage.html.">
        <h2>Moving Directories</h2>
        <p>We only have one directory here so need to make a new one before we can move anything into it. We can make a
            directory called new_backup using <b>mkdir new_backup</b> then move the backup directory into the new-backup
            directory</p>
        <img src="images/moveDirectoryBash.png"
            alt="Bash entered mkdir new_backup bash entered ls bash response backup/ landingPage.html new_backup/ bash entered
        mv backup/ new_backup/ bash entered ls bash response landingPage.html new_backup/ bash entered cd new_backup bash entered ls bash response backup/.">
        <p>Now the backup directory has moved into the directory called new_backup.</p>
