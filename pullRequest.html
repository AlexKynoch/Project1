        <h1>What is a Pull Request?</h1>
        <h2>Making a Pull Request</h2>
       
      
        
        
        <p>A pull request is a way to tell others about a changes you pushed to a git hub repository â€“ this gives others a chance to 
        look at your changes, make suggestions about modifications and approve your changes before committing them to the Master Branch.</p>
    <p>If we were to create a new branch, create a new file and edit it.</p>
        <img src = "images/newFileNano2.png"><br>
        <img src = "images/newFileNano3.png"><br>
        <p>Stage and commit the new file.</p>
        <img src = "images/stageAndCommitFeature.png"><br>
        <p>And push to GitHub.</p>
        <img src = "images/pushToGithub.png"><br>
        <p>If we change the branch in github to landingPage we can see navBar.html</p>
        <img src = "images/featureBranchInGithub.png"><br>
        <p>If we click <b>pull request</b></p>
        <img src = "images/pullRequestGitHub.png"><br>
        <p>Add assignees create pull request the assignees will look at it and if 
        approved it can be merged into the master branch.  As mine has no assignees 
        it's approved has no conflicts and can be merged if I want to.</p>
        <img src = "images/noConflictsGitHub.png"><br>
        <h2>Logs</h2>

        <p><b>git log</b>will show you everthing that was committed. This is everything committed on the landingPage branch.</p>
