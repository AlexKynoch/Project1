        <p>A pull request is a way to tell others about a changes you pushed to a git hub repository â€“ this gives others a chance to 
        look at your changes, make suggestions about modifications and approve your changes before committing them to the Master Branch.</p>
    <p>If we were to create a new branch, create a new file and edit it.</p>
